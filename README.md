How to make them work
=====================

2) Download latest release of UI Library packaged on http://emptykeys.com

3) Extract examples

4) Extract library zip to EmptyKeysUI directory (already created there) in examples directory

5) Just to be sure, check if Nuclex.Fonts.Content.TrueTypeImporter.dll is not blocked by your OS. Unblock it by doing this - http://blogs.msdn.com/b/delay/p/unblockingdownloadedfile.aspx

6) Load any solution in Visual Studio, select AnyCPU and run it

Note for MonoGame: Examples are using standalone version installed by installer (not NuGet). You can download it on http://www.monogame.net/2014/04/07/monogame-3-2/

Note for SunBurn: SunBurn examples are using SunBurn Pro version. You will have to change references if you have different version.
